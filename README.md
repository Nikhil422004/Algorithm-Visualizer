# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool for visualizing **Extended Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, designed to enhance learning in graph theory and pathfinding algorithms.

## Features
- **Graphs:** Includes six unique graph structures for diverse learning scenarios.
- **Extended BFS:**
  - Adapts BFS for weighted graphs by dividing edges into unit segments.
  - Displays dynamic timers near nodes, updating as the algorithm progresses.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
  - Utilizes a priority queue to efficiently compute shortest paths.
  - Highlights edge relaxation and distance updates step-by-step.
  - Displays the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) in green upon completion.
- **Interactive Features:**
  - Editable edge weights to experiment with different configurations.
  - Node buttons to highlight shortest paths upon activation.
  - Step-by-step navigation with arrow keys.
  - A legend for easy reference to visual elements.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Select Algorithm:**
   - Press the right arrow for **Extended BFS**.
   - Press the up arrow for **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.
2. **Navigate Steps:**
   - Use arrow keys to move forward or backward through steps.
3. **Interact:**
   - Click active node buttons to highlight paths or display the SPT.
4. **Access Information:**
   - Hover over the info button (ℹ️) for a detailed legend.
